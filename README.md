# Hangman

In this version of Hangman, a word will be randomly chosen for you to guess. You have 7 lives, or misses, until you lose. If you guess all the letters in the word correctly, you win!

At any point you can type 'save' to save your game and stop the program. You can return to your save file by loading your file when relaunching the program
